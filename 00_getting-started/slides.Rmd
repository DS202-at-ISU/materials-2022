# Data Acquisition and Exploratory Data Analysis

## What is this course about?

* Data Acquisition
    + data ingestion: flat files, data bases, web sites, other (binary) sources
    + ethical issues
* Data Exploration
    + numerical and graphical summaries
    + types of graphics and good visualization practices
    + (simple) modeling
    
## What is this course about? (cont'd)
    
* Data Management
    + Pipeline for data analysis: filtering, transformation, aggregation
    + data (re-)shaping
    + normal forms of data
* Communicating Findings
    + writing reports 
    + web-based applets
* Reproducibility/Repeatability of Findings
    

## Data comes in a lot of different formats

... as sound 
![](data/i-like-r.mp3)

... as image

... in a monitoring device

## 

```{r}
library(tuneR)
ilr_class <- readWave("data/i-like-r.wav")
str(ilr_class)
```

```{r, echo =FALSE, cache = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
ilr_df <- data.frame(left=ilr_class@left, right=ilr_class@right)
ilr_df$time <- 1:nrow(ilr_df)
library(tidyverse)
ilr_df %>% ggplot(aes(time, right)) + geom_line()
```

##

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(jpeg)
img <- readJPEG("data/imgres.jpg")
str(img)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache= TRUE, fig.width=9, fig.height=3}
img_df <- data.frame(expand.grid(y = 1:dim(img)[1], x = 1:dim(img)[2]))
img_df$red <- as.numeric(img[,,1])
img_df$green <- as.numeric(img[,,2])
img_df$blue <- as.numeric(img[,,3])
p1 <- qplot(data=img_df, geom="tile", x =x, y=-y, fill = red) + xlab("") +ylab("") + scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high = "red") + theme(legend.position="none")
p2 <- qplot(data=img_df, geom="tile", x =x, y=-y, fill = green) + xlab("") +ylab("") + scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high = "green")+ theme(legend.position="none")
p3 <- qplot(data=img_df, geom="tile", x =x, y=-y, fill = blue) + xlab("") +ylab("") + scale_fill_gradient(low="white", high = "blue")+ theme(legend.position="none")
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3, nrow=1)
```

# ... we will be using R for that!

## R is ...

* with python most commonly used data science language (see [kdnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/05/poll-top-data-science-machine-learning-platforms.html) survey)
* __Free__ to use, __open source__ so you can see what code is doing to your data
* __Extensible__: Over 18,000 user contributed add-on packages currently on CRAN! Bioconductor has more than 1300 packages, and many researchers provide packages through github.
* __Powerful__
    * With the right tools, get more work done, faster.
* __Flexible__
    * Not a question of _can_, but _how_.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("metacran/crandb")
pkgs <- crandb::list_packages(limit = 999999)
length(pkgs)
# [1] 18506  # 2022
# [1] 12004  # 2018
```

## at the end of the course you will ...

- be able to acquire and read data in different formats and from different sources
- know the basic programming principles of R
- be able to implement a basic data pipeline
- be able to do a data exploration
- visualize data in appropriate forms
- communicate your findings in a reproducible form as report and/or web-app


## Syllabus

Full syllabus is available [from the course website](https://stat480-at-isu.github.io/syllabus.pdf).

###Textbook (optional)

- Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham: *[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)*
- Garrett Grolemund: *[Hands-On Programming with R](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449359019/ref=cm_sw_su_dp)*
- Yihui Xie: *Dynamic Documents with R and knitr*
- additional readings

Course website: 

- Materials, assignments, code: [https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/](https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/)
- Canvas (for grades)



## Grades

| Component | Weight |
|:-- | --:|
| Homework | 20% |
| Labs | 25% |
| Midterm | 25% |
| **Final Project** | |
|   report | 22.5% |
|   presentation | 7.5% |


## Labs

- during class time on every other Thursday (starting with Thursday, Sep 13th) 
- you will be partnered (randomly) in groups of 3 to 4
- lab assignments are designed to be finished during class time, but 'finishing touches' can be applied until the following Monday, 10pm. 
- if you cannot attend the lab, please let me know beforehand. Nevertheless, you are expected to do the work!

## Homework

- in weeks without a lab, a homework is posted.
- homework assignments revise what we covered, plus synthesize some new information.
- plan to spend about 3-4h on each assignment.

## Midterm

- in-class programming exam.
- open book, open note, open internet (no direct help from anyone else).
- tentatively scheduled for Oct 27.
- sample exams will be posted as we get closer to the date.


## Final project

- no final exam.
- team-based project (3-4 members).
- several stages:
    * identify topic and data set
    * identify line of inquiry
    * report findings in report or shiny app
    * present your project in front of the class

## Attendance

I expect you to attend class in some way (f2f or via zoom): there will be a substantial amount of time devoted to 'hands-on' examples on the computers. Make use of that time!

If you have to miss class, please 

(a) let me know ahead of time. 
(b) make sure to catch up with the material (e.g. have a designated note taker, talk to one of your team members, ... )

## Getting Help

There's lots of ways to get help in case you are stuck:

(1) Google is your friend! in particular, stackoverflow and R help are usually great resources,
(2) ask a team member,
(3) write email to the instructor with your question


## Asking a good question

is a learned and valuable skill!

Have a look at:

- stackoverflow's [Asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
- R's [Posting guidelines](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)


## What is this class about?

- very data centric
- I'd like to know what you are interested in

## 

- **Sports** e.g. Baseball salaries and performance
- **Crime data** (incl. type, time, place, demographics etc.)
- **Health** e.g. fitness statistics, or disease rates, or health care costs
- **Movies** e.g. ratings/box office revenues from IMDB
Climate/Weather Data
- **Travel data**, e.g. US flights
- **Environmental Data**: Pollution, Fuel Economy, CO2 Emissions (Carbon Footprint)
- **Global Data**:  World Economy, Social indicators, ...


Anything else you can think of?

## What is exploratory data analysis?

Typical data science project:

![typical cycle of a data science project](data-science.png)


- exploration goes hand in hand with understanding
- our understanding of the world must be based on data

## An example: mind the gap!

Statistician Hans Rosling (1948 - 2017) presented [GapMinder at TED 2006](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen)

- preconceived notions are problematic
- up-to-date data helps us learn about the world

... let's try this out ...
