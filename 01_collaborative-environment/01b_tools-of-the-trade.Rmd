# RStudio is ...

- an excellent IDE for R (and python)

[From Julie Lowndes, Data Scientist at Openscapes](http://jules32.github.io/resources/RStudio_intro/):  

<blockquote>
<b>If R were an airplane, RStudio would be the airport</b>, providing many, many supporting services that make it easier for you, the pilot, to take off and go to awesome places. Sure, you can fly an airplane without an airport, but having those runways and supporting infrastructure is a game-changer.

## The RStudio IDE


1. **Source editor:** Docking station for multiple files, Useful shortcuts ("Knit"), Highlighting/Tab-completion, Code-checking (R, HTML, JS), Debugging features  

2. **Console window:** Highlighting/Tab-completion, Context help, Search recent commands

3. **Environment pane:** Tools for package development, git, etc

4. **Other tabs/panes:** Graphics, R documentation, File system navigation/access

*Protip:* save yourself the headaches figuring out file paths and instead work in an RStudio R project (popup menu at the top left)
