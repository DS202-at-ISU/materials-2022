## Markdown

- Markdown is a particular type of **markup** language.

- Markup languages are designed to **produce documents from plain text**.

- Some of you may be familiar with **LaTeX**. This is another (less human friendly) markup language for creating pdf documents.

- LaTeX gives you much greater control, but it is restricted to pdf and has a much greater learning curve.

- **Markdown** is becoming a **standard**. Many websites will generate HTML from Markdown (e.g. GitHub, Stack Overflow, reddit, ...).

## Markdown is easy

```{r, eval = FALSE}
 *italic*
 **bold**

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- List item 1
- List item 2
    - item 2a
    - item 2b

1. Numbered list item 1
1. Numbered list item 2
    - item 2a
    - item 2b
```


Have a look at RStudio's [RMarkdown cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

... and even nicer: there is a Visual Editor in RStudio!

## What is RMarkdown?

- ... an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R. 

- it combines the core syntax of markdown with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document.

- R Markdown documents are fully reproducible (they are automatically regenerated whenever underlying R code or data changes).

## Your Turn (10 min) 


1. Open RStudio, create a new project - how about `ds202`?.

2. Create a new RMarkdown file (File > New File > R Markdown ...) and knit it.

3. Use the Visual editor to: 
  
  - claim the document by making yourself the author,
  - change some of the text to *italic*,
  - include an enumerated list with three items
  
4. Switch to the source editor and look at the changes. 

5. In a browser, navigate to the RMarkdown cheat sheet and download a copy (Google for the link!)

4. Export output to a different file format (try a word document). If you have Latex installed on your machine you can also try to export to a pdf file.

## Your Turn (5 min) 


1. Make the scatterplot a square (i.e. figure height and figure width should be the same)

2. Hide the code that makes the summary, but show the code for the scatterplot

3. tricky: Include a caption for the scatterplot (you might have to google for this)
