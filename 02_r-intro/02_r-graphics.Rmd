## Questions for the fbi data

---

## Plan for answers

- Explore how one (or more) variables are distributed: *barchart or histogram*

- Explore how two variables are related:  *scatterplot, boxplot, tile plot*

- Explore how two variables are related, conditioned on other variables: *facetting, color & other aesthetics*


---

## Different version of the data

For the exploration, we will use a different shape of the `fbi` data - a wide form:

```{r}
library(classdata)
str(fbiwide)
```

---

## Scatterplots

- need two continuous variables

- we'll be using the `ggplot2` framework for plotting

## Why `ggplot2`

.pull-left[
- Wildly popular package for statistical graphics: over 1.5 million **monthly**  downloads from CRAN since 2019 (several thousand times per day)

- Developed by Hadley Wickham (An ISU Alumni)

- Designed to adhere to good graphical practices

- Constructs plots using the concept of layers

- Supports a wide variety plot types and extensions

## Grammar of Graphics

A graphical representation (plot) consists of:

1. **mappings** (`aes`):  data variables are mapped to graphical elements

2. **layers**:  geometric elements (`geoms`, such as points, lines, 
rectangles, text, ...) and statistical transformations (`stats`, are identity, counts, bins, ...)

3. **scales**: map values in the data space to values in an aesthetic space (e.g. color, size, shape, but also position)

4. **coordinate system** (`coord`): normally Cartesian, but pie charts use e.g. polar coordinates

5. **facetting**: for small multiples (subsets) and their arrangement

6. **theme**: fine-tune display items, such as font and its size, color of background, margins, ...

---

## Scatterplots in `ggplot2`

`aes` allows us to specify mappings; scatterplots need a mapping for `x` and a mapping for `y`:

```
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = burglary, y = homicide)) +
  geom_point()
```  

```
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(burglary), y = log(homicide))) +
  geom_point()
```  

```
ggplot(data = fbiwide, aes(x = log(burglary), 
                           y = log(motor_vehicle_theft))) +
  geom_point()
```

## Revision - Interpreting Scatterplots

- Big patterns
    - Form and direction
    - Strength
    
- Small patterns

- Deviations from the pattern
    - Outliers
    
---

### **Form**

Is the plot linear?  Is the plot curved?  Is there a distinct pattern in the plot? Are there multiple groups?


### **Strength**

Does the plot follow the form very closely?  Or is there a lot of variation?   

### **Direction**
Is the pattern increasing?  Is the plot decreasing?

*Positively:* Above (below) average in one variable tends to be associated with above (below) average in another variable.

*Negatively:* Opposite pattern.

> 3. <font color="darkorange">Direction: Two variables are positively associated.</font>
> 4. <font color="darkorange">No outliers.</font>

<img class="cover" src="images/negative.png" alt="" width=500>

> 1. <font color="darkorange">Form: Roughly linear, two distinct groups (more than 40% and less than 40%.)</font>

## Aesthetics

Can map other variables to size or colour

```
ggplot(aes(x = log(burglary), y = log(motor_vehicle_theft),
           colour=state), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()

ggplot(aes(x = log(burglary), y = log(motor_vehicle_theft),
           colour=year), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()
```

```
ggplot(aes(x = log(burglary), y = log(motor_vehicle_theft),
           size=population), data=fbiwide) + geom_point()
```

## Your turn


- Work through each of the `ggplot2` example plots

- Note: you can turn off a legend (e.g. when there are 50 colors) by adding 
` + theme(legend.position = "none")` to the plot command

- Try variations of the plots to find answers (some of) your questions.
